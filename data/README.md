#TopicAlignment/data

**/data** contains the [data set used by Andreotta et al.](/data/rawdata.csv), who modeled the topics of 41 independent batches of tweets concerning climate change, indicated in the *batch* column of the data set. Three topic solutions were generated, each differing according to the topics generated per batch (i.e., *topicsperbatch* = 5, 10, or 20). For each *topicsperbatch*, a unique ID was allocated to each *topic*. For each *topic*, the ten terms with the strongest relationship to the topic are extracted (though only terms with a value higher than the mean value for all terms are extracted). These *keywords* are delineated with a '|' in the data file. Lastly, the <i>vol</i>ume of tweets in each topic is reported.
