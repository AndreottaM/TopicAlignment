# TopicAlignment/script

**/script** contains two scripts. First, *topicalignment.R* is used to detect the similarities between topics (though, these can be manually entered as .csv in **/out**), group topics according to levels of similarity (these results are stored in **/out**), and deploy an Shiny App to explore/refine results. The second script is *extractIDs.R*, demonstrating how Andreotta et al. extracted tweets from each group of topics. The data file of tweet IDs is not provided due to ethical obligations.
