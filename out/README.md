# TopicAlignment/out

**/out** contains .csv of _similarity matrices_ (for each *topicsperbatch*) and .csv output for topic alignment algorithm (for each *topicsperbatch*). The _topic alignment output_ is structured as */data/rawdata.csv*, with the addition of extra columns equivalent to various thresholds (G3 = similarity threshold of 0.3 as per Andreotta et al., see script for more information). Lastly, **/out** contains the _output files from the Shiny App_ (e.g., *output_k5*). The Shiny App is used to extract groups of topics satisfying certain criteria (see below), and classify the remaining groups as 'unextracted' (i.e., extract = 0). The file is structured as */data/rawdata.csv* with the addition of an *extract* variable denoting each topic's group membership
